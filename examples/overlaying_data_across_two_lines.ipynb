Furthermore, notice how the Reference layer has information about the `Value` variable for each of its segments, while the Input has information about the `Category` variable for each of its segments.\n",

    "It is quite common for us to have situations like these, where linework was generated with different breakpoints, each one of which contains important information, and we are tasked with merging or joining the data to figure out the characteristics of the entire route for all variables across all of the disparate layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind it is actually quite simple. Ultimately, a new DataFrame is created with breaks at every point across the two layers. You can think about this process as trying to find the smallest common denominator, one little piece at a time, across the Reference and Input layers. \n",
