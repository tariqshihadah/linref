    """
    Function for generating events information for existing chains of linear 
    geospatial data based on the geographic lengths of chain members. This 
    function is intended to synthesize a new linear referencing system for 
    chains of adjacent linear data with matching key values, which are 
    oriented in the same direction, and whose end and begin points are 
    coincident or fall within a defined buffer distance of one another.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : gpd.GeoDataFrame
        Valid geopandas GeoDataFrame with linear geometries.
    keys : list or tuple, optional
        A list or tuple of dataframe column labels which define the unique 
        groups of events within the events dataframe. Common examples include 
        year or route ID columns which distinguish unrelated sets of events 
        within the events dataframe. If not provided, it will be assumed that 
        the whole dataframe represents a single group of events. As a result, 
        the only key included in the resulting EventsCollection will be the
        provided `chain_label`.
    beg_label, end_label : str or label
        Column labels to be created within the events dataframe which 
        represent the linearly referenced location of each event.
    chain_label : str or label
        Column label to be created within the events dataframe which indicates 
        the index of the linear chain each given event is associated with.
    buffer : scalar, optional
        A spatial buffer to use when determining if end and begin points 
        are coincident. If not provided, only points which are exactly 
        identical will be determined to be coincident.
    scale : scalar, default 1
        A value to multiply all linearly referenced location values by to 
        transform geographic distance values to a preferred scale. For 
        example, using a value of 5280 to convert from miles to feet.
    decimals : scalar, optional
        If provided, linearly referenced location values will be rounded to 
        the provided number of decimals.
    breaks : {'extend'}
        How to address breaks in linear chains which fall within the same 
        group based on provided keys.

        Options
        -------
        continue : Continue the event bound definitions as if the chains 
            were continuous.
        TBD
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments to be passed to the EventsCollection constructor 
        before returning.
